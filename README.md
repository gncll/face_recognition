# Face Recognition
Developing a face recognition algorithm with two method.

## 1. HOG(Histogram of Gradient) 

Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs study the question sets for robust visual object recognition, adopting linear SVM based human detection as a test case.The show experimentally that grids of Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection.

## 2. Object Detection Method

The algorithm uses edge or line detection features which created by Paul Viola & Michael Jones [in the research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/990517)
